NoBdProcHot for macOS
=================================

This kernel extension allows you to disable *BDPROCHOT* on Macs running the latest Intel Core processors.

Abstract
--------
*BDPROCHOT* stands for Bi-directional Prochot, which is a signal used by peripherals to warn the CPU that they're running hot and thus initiate termal throttling. Apple uses this in their laptops to throttle (very, VERY agressively) their CPUs when the laptops are running without a battery or other hardware faults.
